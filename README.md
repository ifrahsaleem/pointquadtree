I implemented a point quadtree of cities. More specifically, given a 2D
space and a list of cities, each of which is represented as a 2D point, the user inserts the cities in
the order they are given into an initially empty point quadtree. Then, given a query point A in the
same space together with radius r, the program finds all the cities within radius r of A.
